# Core Geometric System â„¢

Geometry Patch Python Library

Empirically derived, exact formulas for calculating  
- circumference,
- area of a circle, 
- volume of a sphere,
- volume of a cone,

and trigonometry based on that the circumference is 6.4r.

The updated formulas can be called in the legacy codebase as functions, avoiding conflict with the existing ones.
